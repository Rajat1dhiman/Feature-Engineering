        "\n",
        "Ans. **sklearn.preprocessing** is a **module in scikit-learn** (a popular machine learning library in Python) that provides a bunch of **utility functions and classes** for preparing your data before feeding it into a machine learning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps with data transformation, which includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Feature Scaling**\n",
        "\n",
        "* StandardScaler – standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* MinMaxScaler – scales features to a specific range, usually [0, 1].\n",
        "\n",
        "* RobustScaler – scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* MaxAbsScaler – scales data to the range [-1, 1] without shifting/centering the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Encoding Categorical Data**\n",
        "\n",
        "* OneHotEncoder – converts categorical variables into a one-hot numeric array.\n",
        "\n",
        "* OrdinalEncoder – encodes categorical features as integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* LabelEncoder – encodes target labels with values between 0 and n_classes-1 (used for target variable, not features).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Normalization**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Normalizer – scales input vectors individually to unit norm (used often in text or signal processing).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Binarization**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Binarizer – converts numerical values into 0s and 1s based on a threshold.\n",
